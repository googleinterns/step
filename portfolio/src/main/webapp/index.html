                        The web application for monitoring students activity,
                        motivating them with bonuses, which they can spend on the swag shop.

                        <br>
                        Done: SPA with events, projects, shop, personal pages, etc.
                        Finished API for some essential things.

                    <p class="project__description">
                        Funny bot which sends you a picture based on a tag that you've given.
                        Result can be REALLY strange, but that's all Imgur API, so we're 
                        out of business.

                        Just a Huffman Archiver on C++, beautiful code with smart pointers, 
                        casting and obvious algorithm for building Haffman tree. 
                        <br>
                        Interesting fact: my teacher said that I should use unique_ptr, and 
                        it wasn't so easy to add them because of priority queue, but I did it, and 
                        then he said: "oops, it wasn't necessary, actually".

                    <h3>CYK with Chomsky Normal Form</h3>
                    <p class="project__description">
                        Just a CYK algorithm with the ability to convert context free grammar to 
                        chomsky normal form.
                        <br>
                        Technologies: Kotlin, ANTLR4
                        <br>
                        I almost died when I implemented CNF algorithm, it cost me 3 or 4 days of suffering and debug.
